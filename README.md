# CRUD
 example with PHP
 Simple test with name and email
 
In this CRUD project (Create, Read, Update and Delete) developed entirely with pure PHP, HTML and CSS, in a simple way I created a table for the user to insert his name and email

This information is shown on the screen, each record has an id that can be viewed in the database and the user has the option of editing or deleting his data

When data is sent through the submit button, the data is automatically forwarded to the database created through MySQL.

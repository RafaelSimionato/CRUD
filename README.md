**CRUD - PHP Example (Name & Email)**

This project is a simple and clean CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built using **pure PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL**.

It allows users to:

* Insert a name and an email through a form
* Store this data automatically in a MySQL database
* View all saved records on the screen
* Edit existing records
* Delete records safely

Each record is stored with a unique `id` in the database, which is used to identify and manage the data.

When the form is submitted:

* The data is validated
* Sent to the database
* Immediately displayed in the user list

This project demonstrates:

* Basic backend logic with PHP
* Database integration using MySQL
* Secure data handling practices
* Fundamental CRUD operations
* A clean and readable structure suitable for learning and portfolio use

It is intentionally simple and lightweight, focusing on clarity, security, and correct implementation of core backend concepts.
